3. **The Statue of Zeus at Olympia (Greece):** A massive seated sculpture of the Greek god.
4. **The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus (present-day Turkey):** Dedicated to the Greek goddess Artemis.
5. **The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus (present-day Turkey):** An elaborate tomb.

It's important to note that only the Great Pyramid of Giza still stands today.  There are also many modern lists of ""Seven Wonders,"" such as the New7Wonders of the World, which are a different set of structures.
